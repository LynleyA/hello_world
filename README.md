Well.. a bit about me.. sometimes, actually most times I actually have no idea what my fellow SANBIts speak of.. my brain tries really hard to keep up with all the new information I recieve each day, and even though I am absorbing, the absorbed info only gets processed and realised once I, myself go through what was heard.. that is the main reason why I never have anytihng to add in meeting..
